# PongFX
A Pong game made in JavaFX

The purpose of this program was to make a Pong game in JavaFX

This is very possible and I have accomplished some of what would be required.

The game sets and resets, and keeps a score. The player can move and have action while the computer AI only moves up and down currently.

There is an issue with the way in which the rectangles are drawn and the ball will sometimes break into the panels, hopefully this issue can be resolved.
